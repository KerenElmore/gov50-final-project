## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to housing in a major city (such as New York), specifically disparities among public housing residents, renters, and home owners. Exploring this data might lead me writing about how housing status (public housing vs renting vs ownership) intersects with race, income, or political affiliation. I would also be interested in thinking about how housing status for families specifically impacts education access and success in children. 

Some other thoughts include:

- Exploring correlations between landownership (specifically in Black or indigenous communities) and climate change

- Exploring companies that follow ESG (Environmental, social, and corporate governance) and the correlation to diversity optimization and environmental mitigation (climate change reduction).
